Unreal engine editor always messes up anything related to self-made vehicle class (actor component). The 2 vehicles in the world need to be given the vehicle component every time the project is opened even if I always save the file with it already present. Everything else saves normally. The HUD blueprint and world blueprint changes every vehicle class type into its own Wheeled Vehicle class type on project reopen.
